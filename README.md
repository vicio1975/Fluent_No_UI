# Fluent_No_GUI
This app allows one to run Ansys Fluent without using the UI and so to reduce memory usage of your pc/workstation/laptop.
You can select the Fluent version, the jornal file, number of cores and type of analyis (for instance 2D/3D).
The jounal file has to address to the cas (+ dat file if you need) by using the full path.
An example of jounral file is attached to this repository.
Best regards,
